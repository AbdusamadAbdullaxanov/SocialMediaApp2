    <p><strong>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose
        programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
        code
        readability with the use of significant indentation.[31]

        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured
        (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
        included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[32][33]

        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and
        first
        released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[34] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as
        list
        comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0,
        released in
        2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was
        discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[35]

        Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages</strong></p>
